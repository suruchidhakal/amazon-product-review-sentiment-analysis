# 📰 Fake News Detection using NLP and Topic Modeling

This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to detect fake news articles using a combination of text preprocessing, topic modeling (LDA), and machine learning.

## Features
- Full preprocessing pipeline (cleaning, tokenization)
- CountVectorizer for feature extraction
- Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling
- Logistic Regression for classification
- Model serialization using Joblib
- Topic visualization

##  Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Gensim
- Matplotlib
- Joblib
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Dataset
The dataset includes labeled fake and real news articles. 

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/suruchidhakal/fake_news_detection_nlp.git
   cd fake_news_detection_nlp
>>>>>>> 11f1d2f (Initial commit - add fake news detection NLP project)
